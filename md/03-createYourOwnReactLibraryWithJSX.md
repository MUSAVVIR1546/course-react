**In React, there is only one HTML page with a main `<div>` called `root`.**  
All React elements are injected into this `root` because React is a single-page application (SPA).  
This HTML page serves as the backbone of the application.

**In the given example, we declare a `reactElement` as an object.**  
This demonstrates that behind the scenes, React treats every element as an object.

- **Type**: This specifies the type of the element (e.g., `'a'` means an anchor tag).  
- **Props**: These are properties of the element, such as `href` and `target`, which are provided as key-value pairs in the object.  
- **Children**: This is the inner content or text of the element.  

**When we create an element in React and inject it into the HTML page, React internally represents it as an object.**

The example includes a loop that iterates over the `props` of the `reactElement`.  
This loop dynamically adds attributes (like `href` and `target`) to the anchor tag.  
Finally, the anchor tag is appended to the live HTML page.
